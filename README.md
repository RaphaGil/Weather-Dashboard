# Weather-Dashboard

## Overview
As part of my Front-End Developer bootcamp, I am currently working on completing the 8th challenge. In this task, developers are tasked with retrieving data from an external application's API and incorporating it seamlessly into their own projects.
For my challenge, I am building a weather dashboard designed to run in the browser. The objective is to create a dynamic user interface with updated HTML and CSS. Leveraging server APIs enables developers to access data and functionality by sending requests with specific parameters to a designated URL.
It's an exciting project that showcases the practical application of API integration in web development.

## Description
This challenge revolves around creating a comprehensive weather forecast application that displays both the current weather and a 5-day forecast. Users can input their desired city, and the application will allow them to save it as a button for future reference. The interface will consist of distinct sections:

. City Input Section: A segment dedicated to entering the city name.
. History Saving Buttons: Buttons to save the search history for quick reference.
. Today's Forecast Section: Displaying the current day's weather details.
. 5-Day Forecast Section: Providing a forecast for the next 5 days, including temperature (in degrees Celsius), humidity, wind velocity, and an icon representing the weather conditions. Additionally, it will feature the date information.

This project aims to create a user-friendly and informative weather dashboard with functionality for both current and future weather predictions.

## Usage
- JavaScript is employed to dynamically display content or sections based on user interactions or navigation, providing a more interactive and user-friendly experience. Server APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL.

## Features
### JavaScript Basics
- Utilizing JavaScript functions and comprehending their usage.
- Implementing logical comparison operators for conditional evaluations.
- Employing conditional statements for decision-making processes.
### Data Handling
- Working with arrays to efficiently store and manipulate data.
- Utilizing loops, especially the for loop, for iterative data processing.
- Introducing and understanding interactive methods like split() and pop() for efficient data manipulation.
### User Interaction
- Engaging users through interactive elements.
- Providing a selection of buttons for city input and history for the city
- Utilizing event listeners to capture user actions effectively.
### Document Manipulation
Working with DOM manipulation methods:
- Using getElementById, querySelector, getElementsByClass, document.createElement, and appendChild for HTML element interaction.
### API
- Server APIs allow to access the data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL.
### Function Interaction and Logical Flow
- Understanding the logical flow of functions and their interactions.
- Comprehending the ways functions interact with each other and with the overall application logic.
